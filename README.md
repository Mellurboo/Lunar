# üê±‚Äçüë§OPEN LUNAR BASIC OPEN OS

Based on my very own LunarOS. this repo uses some of nanobytes code to make it easier to understand
than what is in my private version.

this is for the people who can't be bothered to learn to write a boot loader, this is not a
learning resource this is a stepping stone for thoes who already know all of the 
things that go into making an operating system

## All code here is by

- [@Mellurboo](https://www.github.com/mellurboo) 
- [@Nanobyte](https://www.github.com/nanobyte-dev)


## Software needed
I used kubuntu for this... its free just google it

you're obviously going to use an IDE. I used VSCODE and thats what I suggest. if you wanna use nano or something be my guest but I think your crazy for that.

you need NASM and MAKE installed but if you are using kubuntu that should already be installed, if its not its simple to install just find that install command for the terminal. it also uses C so gcc is needed.

I used Virtual box not qemu. theres no reason behind this I just love it. I am probably going to switch to be honest so just install them both.

## Support

If you need help I might be able to help you. please don't run this on real hardware until I feel it's safe to do so

if you do i wont answer your questions. but any code related issues im happy to help

# Roadmap

- Start working on the FAT system
- Start working on the GUI
- Start working on testing on real hardware, this is hard because as of now LUNAR is NOT compatable with UEFI BIOS.
- Work on getting the OS to boot into a 32bit environment
- Get all of the current project on this repo, that will be done like tonight
