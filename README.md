# OPEN LUNAR BASIC OPEN OS

Based on my very own LunarOS. this repo uses some of nanobytes code to make it easier to understand
than what is in my private version.

this is for the people who can't be bothered to learn to write a boot loader, this is not a
learning resource this is a stepping stone for thoes who already know all of the 
things that go into making an operating system
