Hello o/ thank you for taking a look at my repo. this file is is just a text file that contains some usful info and some explinations.
Firstly hello! My name is Myles i've been a software engineer for like 8 years now, as of writing this im 15 years old. This is a passion project because I feel like
taking on the challenge, this is one of the hardest things a programmer can do that isn't working with like breadboards. I don't have any professional education so I
rely on Nanobyte to teach me all the modern stuff, I have made os's before but I want to give you something you can work with.

Please make sure to read all documentation so uoi atleast learn something from my work, also if you do use my code (that is derived from nanobyte) id really appreciate it
if you just credited me, im not gonna like sue you if you dont but... its just a nice thing to do. again if you read all this and see something that could be better or find
something that doesn't work let me know on discord or somthing (Sulfur#6633). I don't go to like idk harvard for computer science. also im mainly a game developer

either way i hope you like it. ill probably keep this updated with useful info. thank you for using LUNAR BASIC OPEN OS <3
